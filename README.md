Estimate the cost of your Power Apps application and compare costs of the different Microsoft Power Apps licensing models. 

To Power Apps or to custom dev? That is often the question. 
While custom development will typically incur more costs up front and take longer to build, Power Apps will incur licensing fees for the life of the application. When deciding the best fit for your solution and organization, it can be helpful to understand the potential licensing costs.
